# Santa's Slay - Ludum Dare 43

<img src="/assets/images/santas_slay_large.png"/>

I worked with two friends [OKSombre](https://github.com/OKSombre) and [AlpineM](https://github.com/AlpineM) to build Santa's Slay in 72 hours for Ludum Dare 43. We wrote the game from scratch in ES6 using HTML5 canvas for rendering. The theme was "Sacrifices must be made" so in our game, you play as Santa and must deliver the presents at all costs... even if it means sacrificing a few elves. Santa's slay is part platformer, part puzzle game requiring you to trick the elves into falling to their deaths, or get your hands dirty in order to provide you with safe passage to the other side of the spike-ridden arctic.
