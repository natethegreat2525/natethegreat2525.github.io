# Gaggle - Genetic Algorithm Game

<img src="/assets/images/gaggle.png"/>

Gaggle is a genetic algorithm game I developed along with [Thomas Price](https://github.com/thomaswp) for the Global Game Jam in 2014. In Gaggle, you must be the selection algorithm and select creatures to breed in order to complete the level. Creatures inherit behaviors, size, speed, and other stats that affect each level.
