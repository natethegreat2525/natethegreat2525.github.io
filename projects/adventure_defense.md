# Adventure Defense - Ludum Dare 41

<img src="/assets/images/adventure_defense_large.png"/>

I created Adventure Defense in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 41. I wrote the game engine and the rest of the game from scratch in ES6 using PIXI.js for rendering. The theme of the competition was "Combine two incompatible genres". Adventure Defense is a combination of a Tower Defense and an Adventure/Mining game. You must mine the resources around you to get materials to build towers and upgrade your mining equipment. The enemies start quickly and keep you on your toes, always on the verge of running out of resources and letting one slip through.
